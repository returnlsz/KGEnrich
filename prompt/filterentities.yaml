Given a set of user unit queries, triples, and their corresponding triple unit queries (format: triple-triple unit query), each triple is represented as (e1, r, e2), where e1 is the head entity, e2 is the tail entity, and r represents the relationship between the entities. Both e1 and e2 are referred to as entities. Your task is to identify the triple unit queries related to each user unit query and return the entities from the corresponding triples. The output format should be: user unit query-e. If a user unit query corresponds to multiple entities, return them in the format: user unit query-e1-e2-e3-.... If no entities are related to a user unit query, return: user unit query-None. I will provide you with examples; please complete your task after reviewing them.
