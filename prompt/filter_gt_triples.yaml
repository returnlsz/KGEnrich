Given a question, answer(s), topic entity(ies), and a list of triples related to the question, your task is to identify the relevant triples from the given list that can be used to infer the correct answer(s) starting from the topic entity(ies). You should then return these triples. The total number of triples returned should not exceed 100.

The provided list of triples may fall into one of the following three scenarios:
1. The list contains all the key information needed to infer the correct answer(s) from the topic entity(ies).
2. The list contains some, but not all, of the key information needed to infer the correct answer(s) from the topic entity(ies), with some crucial information missing.
3. The list does not contain any key information needed to infer the correct answer(s) from the topic entity(ies).

For these three scenarios, take the following actions and reasoning approaches:
1. **For Scenario 1:** Since the list contains all the necessary information to infer the correct answer(s) from the topic entity(ies), you should analyze the given question, answer(s), topic entity(ies), and the list of triples to identify the critical triples required for inference. Return only these relevant triples.
2. **For Scenario 2:** Since the list provides some of the critical information needed but is missing some pieces for inference, you should analyze the given question, answer(s), topic entity(ies), and the list of triples to identify the triples that contribute to the inference. Additionally, you need to reason and infer any missing key information, create new triples as needed to fill the gaps, and return both the relevant triples from the list and the newly generated triples.
3. **For Scenario 3:** Since the list does not contain any relevant key information, you need to rely on reasoning and analysis based on the given question, answer(s), and topic entity(ies). Generate the missing triples necessary for the inference and return only these newly created triples.
