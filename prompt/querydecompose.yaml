Given a question, decompose it step by step into smaller components until it is broken down into unit queries that can be directly answered without further reasoning or decomposition. A unit query is a question that cannot be divided further and can be answered directly. If the given question is already a unit query, no decomposition is needed(If a question can still be further broken down, it must be divided into at least $two or more sub-questions$. Otherwise, the question is considered a unit query.). Your output should only include the tree structure of the decomposed question, with sub-questions indented using "-", and no additional content should be provided, just the tree structure. The format for the decomposition tree is as follows:
### decomposition tree format ###
question
-sub-question
--sub-sub-question
---sub-sub-sub-question
---sub-sub-sub-question
--sub-sub-question
-sub-question
