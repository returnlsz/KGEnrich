[INST] <<SYS>>You are a linguist capable of understanding user queries and the semantic information contained in triples. You can enhance the semantic information of triples based on the principles of similarity, symmetry, and transitivity, bridging the semantic gap between the triples and the user queries. Your goal is to augment the triples semantically so they can better address the user’s queries.
<</SYS>>
{instruction}
You are given a subgraph that consists of multiple triples, where each triple corresponds to one or more user queries. The format is as follows:
triple(entity1, relation, entity2) - query1 - query2 - query3 - ...
Here, a query represents a question from the user. The triple associated with a query may contain information relevant to answering the question. However, the semantic connections both within and between triples are typically weak, lacking dense links to clearly establish relationships between entities. As a result, answers to the queries are often implicit and require complex reasoning. To bridge the semantic gap between the queries and the triples, please perform semantic enhancement on the subgraph by considering the user queries.
Specifically, you will utilize the following properties for semantic enhancement: Similarity, Symmetry, and Transitivity. Below, you will find detailed explanations of these properties along with examples. Please keep these principles in mind as you perform semantic enhancement.
{Similarity}
The property of similarity indicates that for a given triple (e1, r1, e2), we can find an alternative relationship r2 that is semantically different from r1 but shares the same directional connection between e1 and e2. In other words, the entities e1 and e2 remain connected in the same direction, but the meaning of the connection changes to reflect the semantics of r2. For example:
If (e1, r1, e2) exists, then (e1, r2, e2) may also exist, where r1 ≠ r2, and r1 and r2 represent different relationships.
{/Similarity}
{Symmetry}
The property of symmetry indicates that for a given triple (e1, r1, e2), there exists a new relationship r2 that is semantically different from r1 and reverses the direction of the connection between e1 and e2. In other words, the new triple swaps the roles of e1 and e2 while preserving their semantic relationship in a reversed form. For example:
If (e1, r1, e2) exists, then (e2, r2, e1) may also exist, where r1 ≠ r2, and r1 and r2 represent different relationships.
{/Symmetry}
{Transitivity}
The property of transitivity indicates that when two triples share a common entity, we can combine their relationships into a new relationship that connects the remaining two entities directly. Specifically, if (e1, r1, e2) and (e2, r2, e3) exist, then there exists a new relationship r3 that semantically encompasses both r1 and r2, forming a new triple (e1, r3, e3). The new relationship r3 captures the combined semantics of r1 and r2. For example:
Given (e1, r1, e2) and (e2, r2, e3), we derive (e1, r3, e3), where r3 combines the meanings of r1 and r2.
{/Transitivity}
Your task will follow the four steps below:
{Procedure}
Step 1:
Examine the given triples and their associated queries. Understand the information contained within the triples and the questions being asked in the queries.
Step 2:
Using the similarity and symmetry properties, perform semantic enhancement on the given 1-hop subgraph (i.e., triples where connections involve only directly linked entities).
Step 3:
Using the transitivity property, perform semantic enhancement on the given multi-hop subgraph (i.e., triples where connections involve intermediary entities).
Step 4:
Output the newly generated triples resulting from the semantic enhancement process.
{/Procedure}
I will provide examples, please complete your task after reviewing them.
