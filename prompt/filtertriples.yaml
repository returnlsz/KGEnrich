Given a set of user unit queries, triples, and their corresponding triple unit queries (format: triple-triple unit query), your task is to identify the related subgraph of triple unit queries for each user unit query and return the triples corresponding to those triple unit queries. A user unit query may be associated with multiple triple unit queries or none at all. For each user unit query, find the relevant triples and output them in the format: user unit query-triple. If multiple triple unit queries are related, output in the format: user unit query-triple1-triple2-triple3-..., and if no related triple unit queries exist, output: user unit query-None. I will provide you with examples, please complete your task after reviewing them.

### Example 1:
Input:
user unit queries:
-What is the location that appointed Michelle Bachelet to a governmental position?
--Who is Michelle Bachelet?
--What governmental position was Michelle Bachelet appointed to?
--Where was Michelle Bachelet appointed to this position?
-What language is spoken in this location?
triple unit queries:
(Michelle Bachelet,people.person.nationality,Chile)-What is Michelle Bachelet's nationality?-Which people have Chilean nationality?

{thought}
step 1:
Let’s first identify the triple unit queries. This will help us find the triple unit queries related to each user unit query later. Below are the triple unit queries:
What is Michelle Bachelet's nationality?-(Michelle Bachelet,people.person.nationality,Chile)
Which people have Chilean nationality?-(Michelle Bachelet,people.person.nationality,Chile)
What language is spoken in Chile?-(Chile,language.human_language.countries_spoken_in,Spanish Language)
Which countries speak the Spanish Language?-(Chile,language.human_language.countries_spoken_in,Spanish Language)
step 2:
Let’s analyze each user unit query and find the related triple unit queries.
For the query "What is the location that appointed Michelle Bachelet to a governmental position?",the related query is "What is Michelle Bachelet's nationality?",and the corresponding triple is (Michelle Bachelet,people.person.nationality,Chile)
For the query "Who is Michelle Bachelet?",the related query is "What is Michelle Bachelet's nationality?",and the corresponding triple is (Michelle Bachelet,people.person.nationality,Chile)
For the query "What governmental position was Michelle Bachelet appointed to?",the related query is "What is Michelle Bachelet's nationality?",and the corresponding triple is (Michelle Bachelet,people.person.nationality,Chile)

step 3:
In Step 2, we obtained the triple unit queries related to each user unit query, along with their corresponding triples. We will organize them in the output format of triple-user unit queries.
