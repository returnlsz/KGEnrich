1. **Identifying the Character**: The first few triples indicate that Knox Overstreet is a film character. Specifically, the triple (Knox Overstreet, is_played_by, m.0jx21d) suggests that there is a specific entity (m.0jx21d) associated with the portrayal of Knox Overstreet.

2. **Finding the Actor**: The triple (m.0jx21d, has_actor, Josh Charles) directly states that the entity m.0jx21d is associated with the actor Josh Charles. This indicates that Josh Charles is the actor who plays Knox Overstreet.

3. **Confirming the Relationship**: The triple (m.0jx21d, film.performance.actor, Josh Charles) further confirms that Josh Charles is indeed the actor associated with the performance of the character Knox Overstreet in the film.

4. **Final Verification**: The information consistently points to Josh Charles as the actor portraying Knox Overstreet, with multiple triples supporting this conclusion.

Output:
{thoughts & reason}
To answer the question "what is the official language of Brazil now," I will analyze the provided information. 

From the triples, I see the following relevant ones:
1. (Brazil, current_official_language, Portuguese Language)
2. (Portuguese Language, is_official_language_of, Brazil)

These two triples indicate that the current official language of Brazil is Portuguese. 

Additionally, there are other triples that confirm the relationship between Brazil and the Portuguese language, such as:
- (Brazil, location.country.languages_spoken, Portuguese Language)
- (Portuguese Language, language.human_language.countries_spoken_in, Brazil)

These further reinforce that Portuguese is the primary language spoken in Brazil.

The question also asks if there is only one official language in Brazil. Based on the information provided, it appears that Portuguese is the only official language mentioned, as no other languages are indicated as official in the triples.

Thus, I conclude that the official language of Brazil is Portuguese, and it seems to be the only official language.

Final answer:
Portuguese Language
