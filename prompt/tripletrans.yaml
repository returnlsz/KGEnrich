Given some triples from a knowledge graph, please convert each one into a natural language question. The triple query is formatted as (h, r, ?) and (?, r, t), where "h" represents the head entity and "r" represents the relation and "t" represents the tail entity. The purpose of the query is to identify the set of tail or head entities connected to "h" or "t" through the relation "r". Your task is to transform this query into a question in natural language form. I will provide you with examples, please complete your task after reviewing them.
