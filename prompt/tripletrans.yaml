Given a list of triples in the format (h, r, t), where h represents the head entity, t represents the tail entity, and r represents the relationship between the head and tail entities, your task is to convert each triple into two natural language triple queries using the following two patterns:
1. **(h, r, ?):** Mask the tail entity t. Use the head entity h and the relation r as the known information to generate a question.  
2. **(?, r, t):** Mask the head entity h. Use the tail entity t and the relation r as the known information to generate a question.
For each triple, the result should include two queries in natural language corresponding to the two patterns.
### Example:
Input triple: (Beijing, located in, China)
Conversion:
1. Using the pattern (h, r, ?): "Which country does Beijing locate?"  
2. Using the pattern (?, r, t): "What cities or places are located in China?"
### Output format:
For each triple, write the original triple followed by its two generated queries, separated by `<SEP>`. Use one line per triple.
### Example Output:
(Beijing, located in, China)<SEP>Which country does Beijing locate?<SEP>What cities or places are located in China?
Please follow the specified format to generate the output for all provided triples.
I will provide examples, please complete your task after reviewing them.
