{thoughts & reason}
To answer the question "who plays Ken Barlow in Coronation Street," I need to identify the actor associated with the character Ken Barlow in the provided information. 

The information includes various episodes and details about the character Ken Barlow, but it does not explicitly mention the actor's name. However, I can infer that Ken Barlow is a long-standing character in the show "Coronation Street," which has been running for many years. 

Ken Barlow is a significant character in the series, and historically, he has been portrayed by actor William Roache. Given that the information does not contradict this and considering the prominence of the character, it is reasonable to conclude that William Roache is the actor who plays Ken Barlow.
